Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review my information. I am currently working in the area of data engineering as well as in data analysis, 
for this, I use tools such as Python as a programming language and Snowflake as a database. For data analysis in Python I like to use pandas dataframes, 
plotly and Snowpark, as well as different components from both Python and Snowflake. I have tested ML models with Snowflake Cortex functions. 
I have uploaded data to Snowflake using Python. As well as developed a price web scrapping process in Python.
